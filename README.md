## Work with *[anti-AD](https://github.com/privacy-protection-tools/anti-AD)*:

After Version 4.2.2, Surge is able to load 1,000,000+ rules through ```DOMAIN-SET```. **anti-AD** is an abundant adblocking filter list based on *Easylist* and optimised for Chinese websites. If you like to use **anti-AD** rules through ```DOMAIN-SET```, please subscribe the supplement version (deduplicated already).

DOMAIN-SET example:
```
DOMAIN-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privacy-protection-tools/anti-AD/master/anti-ad-surge2.txt,REJECT

or

DOMAIN-SET,https://anti-ad.net/surge2.txt,REJECT
```

## Work with *Mock (Map Local)*

This feature allows Surge to return an empty json to the network request, which can significantly reduce RAM usage on device than JavaScript(*Yachen Liu, Surge Testflight 1723*). Mocking feature is now universial and available on *Surge Module* and base configuration. **The fuction of mocking in this gist is duplicate with ```URL-REGEX rules```, choose one you prefer.**

## Create your own *[Surge Module](https://manual.nssurge.com/others/module.html)*:
```
#!name=$yourname
#!desc=$yourdescription
// Optional: ignore if you need both
#!system=(ios/mac)

[Rule]
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/master/DOMAINs/EXAMPLE.list,REJECT
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/master/URL-REGEX/EXAMPLE.list,REJECT

[Map Local]
^https://an\.example\.com/ad data="empty.json" // You can generate an empty json on your own surge.

[MITM]
hostname = %APPEND% an.example.com
```

### Why create your own *Module*?

It is your responsibility to avoid risks from the Man-In-The-Middle attack. 
A remote *Module* can be easily incerted any new hostnames and Javascripts, which could significantly increase the risk of your networking safety, if the user did not notice the change when updating the *Module*.

## **Quantumult X** Users?
ADBLOCK-GIST now supports QX with *[domain rules](https://github.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/tree/master/DOMAINs)* compatibly and *[url rewrites rules](https://github.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/tree/master/URL-REWRITE)* exclusively.
